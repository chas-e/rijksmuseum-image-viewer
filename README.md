# SEI-R 629 Project One: Web Application using Rijksmuseum API

## Mandatory To Pass: MVP - Minimum Viable Product
*Your application must meet these requirements:*

1 Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery
2 Hosted on github pages
3 Frequent Commits to github
4 A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
5 Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM


*Here are some "bonus features" but not required:*
1 Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc
2 Look into localstorage so you can save data to the user's browser

## The Story of this Web App
I wanted to center this project on artwork, and choose an art related API from which to fetch data, then render it in my Apps DOM. 

By far, the easiest API to use from a list of public art and design APIS (published here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) was the Rijksmuseum API. This definitely impacted my choice, as other APIs were a little out of my league as a newer engineer.
