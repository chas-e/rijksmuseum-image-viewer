# Rijksmuseum Image Viewer

A web app to quick search artworks from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, NL

## The Story of this Web App
I wanted to center this project on artwork, and choose an art related API from which to fetch data, then render it in my Apps DOM. 

By far, the easiest API to use from a list of public art and design APIS (published here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) was the Rijksmuseum API. This definitely impacted my choice, as other APIs were a little out of my league as a newer engineer.

## Future Enhancements
1 Adding a drag and drop feature that looks into local storage to allow users to save their favorite images to a personal gallery.

2 Fleshing out text transform to allow search by an artist's name that isn't affected by strict name requirements in the museum's API.
